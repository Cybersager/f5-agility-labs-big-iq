Declarative On-boarding (DO) using BIG-IQ
=========================================

**Description**: In this section, we will configure the BIG-IP VE (Virtual Edition) using the Declarative 
On-boarding API on the BIG-IQ. The BIG-IQ will then configure the BIG-IP device and import the device into 
Centralized Management (CM). At the end of this lab, the BIG-IP will be configured with a hostname, NTP, DNS,
network (L2 and L3) and all other settings necessary to begin forwarding traffic.
