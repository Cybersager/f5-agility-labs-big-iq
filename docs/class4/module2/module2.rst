Application Services 3.0 (AS3) using BIG-IQ
===========================================

**Description**: In this section, we will deploy an application using Application Services 3 (AS3). 
AS3 is a declarative API for deploying application and security services. We will first deploy a 
simple application, then layer a firewall policy on top of it, then finally a WAF policy for full
L2 - L7 protections.
